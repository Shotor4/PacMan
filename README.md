# PacMan

<img src='PacMan1.png'>

Pacman will automatically detect when PacMan touches either the left or right side of the WebSites screen and turn around and reverse while also flipping the image to face the in the direction moved.

I have used the JavaScript function setTimeout to automate the movement.

In the future I plan to make the PacMan Change colors when it hits the wall with a random color.
